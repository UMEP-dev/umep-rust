about=SOLWEIG (Solar and Longwave Environmental Irradiance Geometry) is a high-performance urban microclimate model for calculating Mean Radiant Temperature and thermal comfort indices.

    Features:
    - Single timestep and timeseries Tmrt calculations
    - UTCI (Universal Thermal Climate Index) computation
    - PET (Physiological Equivalent Temperature) computation
    - Sky View Factor (SVF) preprocessing
    - EPW & SUEWS weather file import
    - Support for large rasters via tiled processing and GPU

    Requirements:
    - The SOLWEIG Python library must be installed separately.
    - The plugin will offer to install it automatically on first use.
    - To install manually, run this in the QGIS Python Console:
      import pip; pip.main(["install", "solweig"])

    This plugin provides QGIS Processing algorithms that wrap the SOLWEIG Python library. This version of Solweig is currently in testing as a proof of concept for Rust + GPU + tiled processing to handle large rasters.

changelog=
    0.1.0-beta26
    - Apply vegetation transmissivity (psi) to isotropic diffuse SVF: drad, Kup, and Kdown now account for light passing through canopy (previously treated as fully opaque)
    - Add configurable leaf-off transmissivity to physics defaults (was hardcoded to 0.5)
    - Expose vegetation parameters in QGIS: transmissivity (leaf-on/off), seasonal leaf dates — all as advanced options
    0.1.0-beta25
    - Fix GVF shadow convention inversion: simplified (no-walls) path now correctly attenuates ground temperature in shaded areas instead of sunlit areas
    - Fix CDSM/TDSM below-threshold clamping: near-ground vegetation now clamps to base elevation instead of absolute zero
    - Fix state mutation in thermal delay: copy state before mutating to prevent cross-timestep contamination
    - Fix nighttime result NaN propagation: NaN pixels in DSM now propagate to nighttime Tmrt output
    - Fix division by zero in diffuse fraction at sunrise/sunset (sin(altitude) ≈ 0)
    - Fix log(0) crash in clearness index when sun is exactly at horizon
    - Fix TMY date filter for month-crossing ranges (e.g. Dec→Jan)
    - Fix altmax not floored at 0 for polar winter (negative max sun altitude)
    - Fix missing conifer/precomputed parameters in single-tile fallback path
    - Mark non-fused calculate_core() as deprecated in favour of Rust pipeline
    0.1.0-beta24
    - Skip tiling for nighttime timesteps: compute nighttime result on full grid in one pass instead of iterating all tiles
    - Nighttime timesteps now complete in milliseconds instead of processing N tiles with GPU pipeline overhead
    0.1.0-beta23
    - Fix EPW hour-24 timestamp bug: hour 24 now correctly maps to midnight of the next day instead of 00:00 of the same day
    - Fix hardcoded Gothenburg lat/lon defaults: EPW download and SOLWEIG calculation now default to the map canvas centre (WGS 84)
    0.1.0-beta22
    - GPU pipelining: auto-split rasters >= 512px into at least 4 tiles (2x2) for sustained GPU utilisation
    - Previously, height-aware buffer could cause medium rasters to fit in a single tile, leaving the GPU idle during CPU-only pipeline steps
    - Add opt-in timing instrumentation (SOLWEIG_TIMING=1) to measure per-step CPU/GPU breakdown and GPU duty cycle
    - Timing covers both Rust pipeline steps (shadow, ground temp, GVF, thermal delay, radiation, Tmrt) and Python tile overhead (extract, FFI, merge)
    0.1.0-beta21
    - Height-aware tile buffer: compute overlap from tallest DSM pixel via calculate_buffer_distance() instead of always using max_shadow_distance_m (500m default)
    - Short buildings (e.g. 10m) now get ~191m buffer instead of 500m, reducing tile count and overlap waste
    - Fix stale log line in calculate_tiled() that reported max_shadow_distance_m instead of actual buffer
    - Remove shadowed logger in calculate_tiled()
    0.1.0-beta20
    - QGIS progress monitor now shows current timestamp and tile during timeseries runs
    - Auto-tile large rasters in QGIS timeseries path (was previously untiled, risking OOM)
    - Resource-aware tile sizing: query real GPU buffer limits (wgpu adapter) and system RAM instead of hardcoded 256 MiB / 2500 px constants
    - Expose gpu_limits() from Rust to Python (solweig.get_gpu_limits())
    - Larger tile sizes on capable hardware (fewer tiles = less overhead)
    0.1.0-beta19
    - Fix import sorting and unused imports (ruff formatting)
    0.1.0-beta18
    - Enable anisotropic sky model by default (use_anisotropic_sky=True)
    - Port Perez sky luminance model to Rust (eliminates Python round-trip)
    - Fix bitpacked shadow matrix extraction in pipeline (was reading packed bytes as patch values)
    - Fix veg shadow initialization: no-vegetation surfaces no longer attenuate diffuse radiation
    - Release GIL during compute_timestep for better multi-threaded performance
    - Add steradians caching on ShadowArrays
    - Add 38 new tests: bitpacking round-trip, diffsh formula, Perez parity, end-to-end anisotropic pipeline
    0.1.0-beta17
