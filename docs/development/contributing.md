# Contributing

Contributions to SOLWEIG are welcome.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Rust toolchain (for building extensions)
- uv (package manager)

### Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UMEP-dev/solweig.git
cd solweig

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Build Rust extension
maturin develop
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Run tests
pytest ./tests

# Full verification (format, lint, typecheck, test)
poe verify_project
```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Make changes
3. Run verification: `poe verify_project`
4. Commit with clear messages
5. Open a pull request

### Code Style

The following tools are used (configured in `pyproject.toml`):

| Tool | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| **ruff** | Linting and formatting |
| **ty** | Type checking |
| **pytest** | Testing |

Run all checks:

```bash
poe verify_project
```

### Testing

Tests are located in `tests/`:

- `tests/spec/` — Physical property tests (shadows, SVF, radiation)
- `tests/golden/` — Reference data validation
- `tests/test_api.py` — Integration tests

Add tests for new functionality:

```bash
# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/test_api.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=solweig tests/
```
