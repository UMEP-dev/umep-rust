# Physics Overview

SOLWEIG (Solar and Longwave Environmental Irradiance Geometry) calculates the mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) by modeling the complete radiation budget at a point in an urban environment.

## Radiation Budget

The total radiation received by a human body is:

$$
R_{total} = R_{short} + R_{long}
$$

Where:

- **Shortwave** ($R_{short}$): Direct and diffuse solar radiation
- **Longwave** ($R_{long}$): Thermal radiation from sky, ground, and walls

## Component Models

Detailed specifications for each component are maintained in the [`specs/`](https://github.com/UMEP-dev/solweig/tree/main/specs) directory.

### 1. Sky View Factor (SVF)

Fraction of sky visible from each point, accounting for buildings and vegetation.

### 2. Shadow Calculation

Sun position and ray tracing to determine shadow patterns.
