# Validation Report

SOLWEIG is validated against field radiation measurements from three sites in
Gothenburg, Sweden. All validation data — geodata, met files, measurement CSVs,
and POI coordinates (as GeoJSON) — are self-contained under `tests/validation/`
and run automatically in CI on every push and PR.

Each site's POI (point of interest) is loaded at runtime from a `poi.geojson`
file and projected onto the DSM grid. The GeoJSON coordinates were extracted
from the original shapefiles provided with each validation dataset.

## POI sweep analysis

The POI sweep runs the full SOLWEIG pipeline once per site, then evaluates
the modelled Tmrt time series at every ground-level pixel against the same
single set of field observations. The resulting RMSE/R²/bias heatmaps show
how sensitive the validation statistics are to the assumed measurement
location — they do not represent spatial maps of model error. A pixel with
low RMSE means that, had the instrument been placed there, the modelled and
observed Tmrt would have agreed more closely.

Run with: `pytest tests/validation/test_poi_sweep_all_sites.py -v -s`

### Gustav Adolfs torg sweep

![POI sweep RMSE — Gustav Adolfs](tests/validation/gustav_adolfs/poi_sweep_results/poi_sweep_rmse.png)

The measurement station POI (33, 77) sits in the open square. Pixels near
the western buildings show lower RMSE (~8 °C vs ~13 °C), where shadow
patterns are more uniform. The open-square location is the documented
measurement position.

### Kronenhuset sweep

![POI sweep RMSE — Kronenhuset](tests/validation/kronenhuset/poi_sweep_results/poi_sweep_rmse.png)

The measurement station POI (51, 117) is in the courtyard, consistent with
the described field setup (Tmrt RMSE ~6 °C).

### GVC sweep

![POI sweep RMSE — GVC](tests/validation/gvc/poi_sweep_results/poi_sweep_rmse.png)

The measurement station POI (51, 122) corresponds to Site 1 from
Lindberg & Grimmond (2011). This pixel sits at the edge of a dense tree
canopy in the CDSM (heights of 7–18 m immediately to the west and south),
making the modelled shadow state sensitive to sub-pixel canopy position.
Nearby pixels in more open areas show lower RMSE (~4–5 °C).

---

## Known limitations

### Kdown at open sites

Point-level downwelling shortwave (Kdown) has high RMSE (175–344 W/m²).
At any single pixel the shadow state is binary, so a small shift in the
modelled shadow boundary produces ~800 W/m² differences between timesteps.
Spatially averaged Kdown would show considerably lower error.

### Ldown overestimation

The model overestimates Ldown at all sites (bias +39 to +83 W/m²). The
SOLWEIG Ldown formulation (Jonsson et al. 2006) fills the non-sky hemisphere
with wall emissions at emissivity 0.90 and air temperature. In practice,
shaded walls are cooler than air temperature, which introduces a positive bias.

- At SVF = 1.0 (open sky), clear-sky Ldown matches observations well.
- The bias increases at sites with lower SVF, where more of the hemisphere
  is filled with wall emissions.
- The Jonsson et al. (2006) empirical correction of −25 W/m² is present but
  commented out in all UMEP releases (2021a, 2022a, 2025a) and is not applied
  here.

### GVC Tmrt accuracy

The GVC site shows higher Tmrt RMSE (11–16 °C) and near-zero R² compared to
the other two sites. Contributing factors include:

- The measurement station (Site 1) is adjacent to dense tree canopy in the
  CDSM, making the modelled shadow state sensitive to sub-pixel canopy
  position at 2 m resolution.
- Only 7–12 matched hours per day are available, which limits the statistical
  power of per-day metrics such as R².

## Comparison with published results

Lindberg et al. (2008) report aggregate statistics over 7 days at two
Gothenburg sites (~189 hours):

| Component |   R² |      RMSE |
| --------- | ---: | --------: |
| Tmrt      | 0.94 |     4.8 K |
| L↓        | 0.73 | 17.5 W/m² |
| L↑        | 0.94 | 15.6 W/m² |

The Kronenhuset Tmrt RMSE of 6.0 °C from this implementation is in a similar
range to the paper's 4.8 K. The paper's statistics are aggregated across more
hours and sites, and the paper validates against 1-minute averaged measurements,
whereas the met data used here are hourly.

## Running validation tests

```bash
# All validation tests (fast data-loading + slow pipeline)
pytest tests/validation/ -m validation

# Just the fast data-loading checks
pytest tests/validation/ -m "validation and not slow"

# A single site
pytest tests/validation/test_validation_gvc.py -v -s

# POI sensitivity sweep (all sites, generates PNG heatmaps)
pytest tests/validation/test_poi_sweep_all_sites.py -v -s
```
