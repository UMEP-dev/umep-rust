# Sky View Factor (SVF)

Fraction of the sky hemisphere visible from each point. Determines how much diffuse sky radiation and longwave sky emission reaches the surface.

**Reference:** Lindberg et al. (2008) Section 2.1, Lindberg & Grimmond (2011)

## Equation

SVF is the ratio of radiation received from the sky to that from an unobstructed hemisphere:

```text
SVF = Ω_sky / 2π
```

Where Ω_sky is the solid angle of visible sky (steradians).

## Patch-Based Calculation Method

**Reference:** Robinson & Stone (1990) "Solar Radiation Modelling in the Urban Context", Building and Environment 25(3):201-209.

SOLWEIG uses the patch-based method where the sky hemisphere is divided into discrete angular patches (annuli). SVF is computed by testing visibility to each patch and weighting by the patch's solid angle.

### Patch Configuration

The sky is divided into concentric annuli (altitude bands) from 0° to 90° elevation. Each annulus is further subdivided into azimuthal patches. Standard configurations:

- **Option 1** (145 patches): Coarse for fast computation
- **Option 2** (153 patches - default): Balance of accuracy and speed
- **Option 3** (306 patches): Fine for high accuracy
- **Option 4** (930 patches): Research-grade resolution

For option 2 (153 patches):

- 8 altitude bands: 6°, 18°, 30°, 42°, 54°, 66°, 78°, 90°
- Azimuthal divisions per band: 31, 30, 28, 24, 19, 13, 7, 1

### Solid Angle Weight Calculation

Each patch's contribution to SVF is weighted by its solid angle. The discretized computation in `skyview.rs`:

```text
n = 90
common_w_factor = (1 / (2π)) × sin(π / (2n))
steprad_iso = (360 / azimuth_patches) × (π / 180)
steprad_aniso = (360 / azimuth_patches_aniso) × (π / 180)

sin_term_sum = Σ sin(π(2a - 1) / (2n))    for a in annulino_start..=annulino_end

weight_iso = steprad_iso × common_w_factor × sin_term_sum
weight_aniso = steprad_aniso × common_w_factor × sin_term_sum
```

Where:

- `azimuth_patches` = number of azimuthal divisions in this altitude band (isotropic)
- `azimuth_patches_aniso` = `ceil(azimuth_patches / 2)` (directional, covering half-hemisphere)
- `annulino_start..annulino_end` = range of annulus indices within the altitude band

The isotropic weight is used for total SVF. The anisotropic weight is used for directional SVFs (N, E, S, W), with each directional component only accumulating patches whose azimuth falls within its 180° half-hemisphere.

### SVF Accumulation Formula

```text
SVF = Σ_patches (weight_iso × visibility_patch)
```

Where:

- weight_iso = pre-computed isotropic solid angle weight for the patch
- visibility_patch = 1 if patch center is unobstructed, 0 if blocked by DSM

### Last Annulus Correction

A correction factor `LAST_ANNULUS_CORRECTION = 3.0459e-4` is added during finalization. This compensates for the zenith patch (90°) being represented as a single point rather than a solid angle. Without this correction, a completely unobstructed view would sum to slightly less than 1.0.

### Directional SVF

Directional components split patches by azimuth half-hemisphere:

```text
SVF_north = Σ (weight_aniso × visibility) for azimuth ∈ [270°, 360°) ∪ [0°, 90°)
SVF_east  = Σ (weight_aniso × visibility) for azimuth ∈ [0°, 180°)
SVF_south = Σ (weight_aniso × visibility) for azimuth ∈ [90°, 270°)
SVF_west  = Σ (weight_aniso × visibility) for azimuth ∈ [180°, 360°)
```

## Properties

### Range Properties

1. **SVF in range [0, 1]**
   - SVF = 0: no sky visible (e.g., inside building)
   - SVF = 1: full hemisphere visible (open field)
   - All intermediate values valid

2. **Directional SVF in range [0, 1]**
   - Each directional component (N, E, S, W) also bounded by [0, 1]

### Geometric Properties

3. **Flat open terrain = SVF of 1**
   - No obstructions → full sky visibility
   - Tolerance: SVF > 0.95 for truly flat DSM

4. **Deep canyon has low SVF**
   - Urban canyon with H/W ratio > 2 → SVF < 0.5
   - H = building height, W = street width

5. **Taller obstacles reduce SVF**
   - Higher buildings nearby → lower ground-level SVF
   - SVF decreases monotonically with obstacle height

6. **Rooftops have high SVF**
   - Building tops (local maxima) have SVF close to 1
   - Only reduced if taller buildings nearby

7. **Building density reduces SVF**
   - More buildings → lower ground-level SVF
   - SVF is a measure of urban density/openness

### Symmetry Properties

8. **Symmetric obstacles give symmetric directional SVF**
   - Square courtyard center has equal N/E/S/W SVF
   - Asymmetric buildings create asymmetric directional SVF

## Directional SVF

Directional components split the sky into half-hemispheres:

```text
         N (svf_north)
         |
    W ---+--- E
         |
         S
```

Used for calculating radiation from different sky directions, important for:

- Anisotropic sky radiance (brighter near sun)
- Wall orientation effects
- Asymmetric shading

## Vegetation Effects

Trees reduce SVF but not completely (light passes through canopy):

- **svf_veg**: Sky view through vegetation canopy
- Accounts for the pergola shadow heuristic (see shadows.md)
- svf_veg >= svf (vegetation blocks less than buildings)
