# Ground View Factor (GVF)

Computes ground- and wall-emitted radiation integrated across all visible surfaces from a point at person height. Despite the name, the primary outputs are thermal emission (Lup in W/m²) and albedo-weighted view factors, not a simple dimensionless view factor.

## Algorithm

GVF is computed by integrating visible ground and wall surfaces across 18 azimuth directions (5° start, 20° step, covering 360°). For each azimuth, rays march outward from each pixel to detect buildings and walls, accumulating their thermal and reflective contributions.

### Integration Distances

Two distance scales are used, based on person height:

```text
first  = round(height × pixel_scale), min 1   (near-field, ~person height in pixels)
second = round(height × 20 × pixel_scale)      (far-field, ~20× person height in pixels)
```

### Near/Far Weighting

The final GVF is a weighted blend of near-field and far-field results:

```text
gvf      = (gvf1 × 0.5 + gvf2 × 0.4) / 0.9
gvf_lup  = (gvfLup1 × 0.5 + gvfLup2 × 0.4) / 0.9 + lup_local × (1 - buildings)
gvf_alb  = (gvfalb1 × 0.5 + gvfalb2 × 0.4) / 0.9 + alb_grid × (1 - buildings) × shadow
```

The near-field captures local wall effects; the far-field captures distant ground/wall contributions. The `(1 - buildings)` term adds the local ground contribution for non-building pixels.

### Longwave Emission (Differential Formula)

The Lup contribution per azimuth uses a differential formula — computing excess emission above ambient:

```text
lup_diff = SBC × emis × (Tg × shadow + Ta + 273.15)⁴ - SBC × emis × (Ta + 273.15)⁴
```

The final `gvf_lup` adds the ambient baseline back:

```text
gvf_lup = weighted_sum(lup_diff) + SBC × emis × (Tg_local × shadow + Ta + 273.15)⁴
          - SBC × emis × (Ta + 273.15)⁴ + that last term for non-building pixels
```

For walls, a similar differential:

```text
lwall = SBC × ewall × (tgwall + Ta + 273.15)⁴ - SBC × ewall × (Ta + 273.15)⁴
```

Where `tgwall` is the wall temperature deviation from air temperature (K), only applied to sunlit walls.

### Water Temperature Override

When land cover data is active (`landcover=true`), water pixels (lc_grid == 3) have their ground temperature overridden:

```text
Tg_water = Twater - Ta    (Twater from weather file)
```

This bypasses the land cover parameter table (TgK/TmaxLST) for water surfaces.

### Sunwall Mask

A sunwall mask identifies building pixels adjacent to sunlit walls:

```text
sunwall = 1.0 if wallsun > tolerance AND walls > 0
```

This determines whether wall-temperature terms (heated walls) or ambient-temperature terms are used for nearby building faces.

### Geometry Caching

The ray-tracing geometry (building blocking distances, wall influence masks) can be precomputed once and reused across timesteps. The cached path (`sun_on_surface_cached`) skips the expensive ray-marching and only recomputes the thermal-dependent outputs (`gvf_lup`, `gvfalb`). The purely geometric output (`gvfalbnosh`) is taken directly from the cache.

Note: `gvf_lup` has units of W/m² (contains emission calculation), not dimensionless. `gvfalb` already contains albedo weighting and is used directly by the radiation budget — it is not a pure view factor.

## Properties

### Output Properties

1. **gvf_lup contains thermal emission**
   - Not a dimensionless factor — units are W/m²
   - Includes both ground and wall longwave contributions
   - Higher in urban canyons (more wall emission)

2. **gvfalb includes albedo**
   - Already albedo-weighted; no further multiplication by albedo needed
   - Shadow-dependent: higher in sunlit areas (more reflected shortwave)

3. **gvfalbnosh is purely geometric**
   - Independent of shadow state and weather
   - Can be cached across timesteps (used by geometry cache)

### Geometric Properties

1. **Flat open terrain**
   - gvf_lup ≈ local ground emission only
   - No wall contributions

2. **Urban canyon has high wall contribution**
   - Walls on both sides increase gvf_lup
   - More reflected and emitted radiation in canyons

3. **Directional asymmetry**
   - East-facing wall contributes to western GVF (seen from west)
   - Asymmetric building layout → asymmetric directional outputs

## Role in Radiation Budget

GVF outputs feed directly into the radiation computation:

**Reflected Shortwave (Kup)**: Uses `gvfalb` and `gvfalbnosh` directly (albedo already baked in):

```text
kup = gvfalb × rad_i × sin(altitude) + ct × gvfalbnosh
```

**Longwave Upwelling (Lup)**: Uses `gvf_lup` after thermal delay smoothing:

```text
Lup = TsWaveDelay(gvf_lup, ...)    [smoothed across timesteps]
```
