## Overview

Ground surface temperature directly affects upwelling longwave radiation (Lup), which contributes significantly to mean radiant temperature in urban environments. The model accounts for:

1. **Solar heating** - Direct and diffuse radiation absorption
2. **Thermal inertia** - Delayed response due to material heat capacity
3. **Surface properties** - Albedo, emissivity, thermal conductivity

## TsWaveDelay Model

The thermal delay model simulates ground temperature response to changing radiation conditions using an exponential decay function.

### Equation

```text
T_ground(t) = T_current × (1 - w) + T_previous × w

where:
    w = exp(-33.27 × Δt)
    Δt = time since last update (fraction of day)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Decay constant | 33.27 | Thermal response rate (day⁻¹) |
| Time threshold | 59/1440 | Minimum time step (~59 minutes) |

### Physical Interpretation

The decay constant (33.27 day⁻¹) corresponds to a thermal time constant of approximately:

```text
τ = 1 / 33.27 ≈ 0.030 days ≈ 43 minutes
```

This represents the characteristic time for surface temperature to respond to changes in radiative forcing. After one time constant:

- 63% of adjustment to new equilibrium
- After 3τ (~2 hours): 95% adjustment

### Algorithm

In Rust: `ts_wave_delay(gvf_lup, firstdaytime, timeadd, timestepdec, tgmap1)` and `ts_wave_delay_batch_pure` for batched 6-in-1 processing (center + 4 directional + ground).

```python
def TsWaveDelay(T_current, firstdaytime, time_accumulated, timestep, T_previous):
    """
    Apply thermal delay to ground temperature.

    Args:
        T_current: Current radiative equilibrium temperature
        firstdaytime: True if first timestep after sunrise
        time_accumulated: Time since last full update (fraction of day)
        timestep: Current timestep duration (fraction of day)
        T_previous: Previous delayed temperature

    Returns:
        T_delayed: Temperature with thermal inertia applied
        time_accumulated: Updated time accumulator
        T_previous: Updated previous temperature for next iteration
    """
    if firstdaytime:
        T_previous = T_current

    if time_accumulated >= 59/1440:  # ~59 minutes threshold
        weight = exp(-33.27 * time_accumulated)
        T_previous = T_current * (1 - weight) + T_previous * weight
        T_delayed = T_previous
        time_accumulated = timestep if timestep > 59/1440 else 0
    else:
        time_accumulated += timestep
        weight = exp(-33.27 * time_accumulated)
        T_delayed = T_current * (1 - weight) + T_previous * weight

    return T_delayed, time_accumulated, T_previous
```

## Surface Temperature Parameterization

For computing the instantaneous radiative equilibrium temperature, SOLWEIG uses a linear parameterization based on solar altitude.

### Sinusoidal Diurnal Model

The ground temperature deviation from air temperature follows a sinusoidal diurnal phase (`rust/src/ground.rs`):

```text
Tgamp = TgK × altmax + Tstart

if dectime > sunrise_frac:
    phase = (dectime - sunrise_frac) / (TmaxLST_frac - sunrise_frac)
    Tg = Tgamp × sin(phase × π/2)
else:
    Tg = 0    (pre-sunrise: no deviation from air temp)
```

Where:

- `Tgamp` = maximum temperature amplitude (°C above air temp)
- `TgK` = temperature increase rate (°C per degree of max solar altitude)
- `altmax` = maximum solar altitude during the day (°)
- `Tstart` = temperature offset at sunrise (°C)
- `dectime` = current time as fraction of day
- `sunrise_frac` = sunrise time as fraction of day
- `TmaxLST_frac` = time of maximum surface temperature as fraction of day

### Clearness Index Correction

After computing the sinusoidal Tg, a clearness index correction is applied to account for non-clear sky conditions:

```text
corr = 0.1473 × ln(90 - zenith_deg) + 0.3454
CI_TgG = (radG / radG0) + (1 - corr)
CI_TgG = min(CI_TgG, 1.0)
Tg = max(Tg × CI_TgG, 0.0)
```

Where `radG` is measured global radiation and `radG0` is theoretical clear-sky radiation. Under clear skies CI_TgG ≈ 1.0; under overcast conditions CI_TgG < 1.0, reducing the ground temperature response.

### Land Cover Parameters

| Surface Type | Tstart (°C) | k (°C/°) | TmaxLST | Source |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ------ |
| Cobblestone | -3.41 | 0.37 | 15:00 | Lindberg et al. (2016) |
| Dark asphalt | -9.78 | 0.58 | 15:00 | Lindberg et al. (2016) |
| Grass | -3.38 | 0.21 | 14:00 | Lindberg et al. (2016) |
| Bare soil | -3.01 | 0.33 | 14:00 | Estimated |
| Water | 0.0 | 0.00 | 12:00 | Estimated |

Note: Tstart is the temperature offset from air temperature at sunrise. Negative values indicate surfaces cooler than air at dawn.

**Water temperature override:** When land cover is active (the normal path), water pixels (lc_grid == 3) bypass this table entirely — their ground temperature is set to `Twater - Ta` from the weather file. The TgK/TmaxLST values only apply in the rare no-landcover fallback. With TgK=0.00, Tgamp=0 making TmaxLST irrelevant.

## Properties

### Thermal Inertia Effects

1. **Morning lag** - Surfaces warm slower than instantaneous equilibrium
2. **Afternoon persistence** - Surfaces remain warm after solar maximum
3. **Evening cooling** - Gradual temperature decrease after sunset

### Material Dependence

4. **High thermal mass** (concrete, stone): Slower response, τ > 1 hour
5. **Low thermal mass** (thin asphalt): Faster response, τ < 30 minutes
6. **Vegetation**: Complex due to evapotranspiration

### Diurnal Pattern

```text
Morning:  T_ground < T_equilibrium (heating lag)
Midday:   T_ground ≈ T_equilibrium (near steady state)
Afternoon: T_ground > T_equilibrium (cooling lag)
Night:    T_ground slowly approaches T_air
```

## Implementation Notes

### State Management

The thermal delay model requires state to be carried between timesteps:

- 6 directional `tgmap1` arrays (center, E, S, W, N, ground)
- `tgout1` — ground temperature output history
- `firstdaytime` flag — reset on first timestep after sunrise
- `timeadd` accumulator — tracks time since last full update
- `timestep_dec` — current timestep as fraction of day

For accurate results, use `calculate()` with a timeseries of weather data, which automatically manages thermal state. Single-timestep calculations will not capture thermal inertia effects.

### Directional Components

Ground temperature affects directional Lup components (Lup_E, Lup_S, Lup_W, Lup_N) which are computed using Ground View Factors in each direction. The `ts_wave_delay_batch_pure` function processes all 6 directional channels in a single call.

### Nighttime Behavior

Pre-sunrise (dectime <= sunrise_frac):

- Ground temperature deviation Tg = 0 (no deviation from air temperature)
- The TsWaveDelay model handles smooth transitions via thermal inertia
- Emissivity assumed constant (typically 0.95)

## Validation Status

The TsWaveDelay model parameters (decay constant 33.27) require validation against:

- [ ] In-situ surface temperature measurements
- [ ] Comparison with force-restore energy balance models
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis for different surface types

The current parameterization is empirical and may need adjustment for specific climates or surface materials.
